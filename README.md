## FTP file base

Client sends the file name to the server
- The server, if that file exists, sends the contents of the file to the client line by line. Otherwise it sends an error message to the client
- The client shows on the screen the file lines received from the server or, in case of an error, shows the user the error message


## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `out`: containt the server output file
